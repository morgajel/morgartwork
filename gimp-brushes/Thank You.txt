You can use these brushes as you wish; this is my own original artwork and you 
can implement it as you see fit. If you do use it in a professional setting, I 
beg of you to drop me a line at morgajel@gmail.com and let me see.

I welcome feedback and appreciate ratings. If this brush is popular, I'll
create a few more like it.

Have fun!
